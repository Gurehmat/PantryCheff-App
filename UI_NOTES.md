# UI Notes

Goal: replicate the Figma-site look exactly.

Key characteristics:
- Clean centered content column
- Light mode is primary (white background, light gray surfaces)
- Rounded cards for rows
- Category chips are pill buttons, active is dark-filled
- Modal is centered with backdrop, tidy form spacing
- Recipes are a 3-column card grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile
- Shopping empty state centered with icon + text

Do not:
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Use Material/Android styling
- Use huge empty spacing or heavy borders
